## Technical Considerations

This project uses JSON Schema to define the data structure for the disclosure data. The schema is located in the `schema` directory. The schema is based on the [JSON Schema 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#2020-12) specification.

### Understanding the Schema

    Optional schema items can be added here using the information available here:
